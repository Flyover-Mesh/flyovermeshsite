**Typically, you can add the `flyover` channel** to your Meshtastic device by adding a new channel:
- Name: `flyover`
- Key Size: `8 bit` or `Default`
- Key: `AQ==`
- Channel Role: `Secondary`

This assumes you're set to Long Fast, that Long Fast is the name of your Default or Channel 0, and you've made no other deeper config changes.

**It's also possible that you've done something special.** In that case, you probably know how to use the above information to add a channel. Good Job!
