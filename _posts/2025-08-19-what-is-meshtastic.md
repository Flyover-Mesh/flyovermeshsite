# What is Meshtastic?

**DIY Text messaging**

Meshtastic is free, open-source software that runs on inexpensive LoRa (Long Range) radios. These small devices form a mesh network, allowing people to send text messages and share GPS locations over distances of several miles, all without relying on any other infrastructure.

No power grid. No cell service. No internet. Just radios talking to radios.

## How does it work?

Imagine passing a note in class. You write a message, hand it to the person next to you, and they pass it along until it reaches everyone in the room.

Meshtastic works the same way, except instead of paper, you're sending digital messages over radio waves. Each device in the network receives a message and rebroadcasts it, extending the range far beyond what any single radio could reach on its own. Messages hop from node to node until they reach their destination.

Your phone connects to your radio via Bluetooth, and the Meshtastic app (available for iPhone and Android) gives you a familiar texting interface. You can also use it without a phone by using a device with a keyboard and screen.

## What can you do with it?

**Public messages:** Broadcast to everyone, like a local social feed.

**Private channels:** Create private, encrypted channels for your family, friends, or organization.

**Direct messages:** Send encrypted one-on-one direct messages to specific users. (with limited success)

**Location sharing:** See where other mesh users are on a map (if they choose to share).

**Much more:** Meshtastic sends text messages, but it can also send many other kinds of data over the mesh. Location was mentioned alread, but many radios can be augmented with weather sensing equipment or connected to another computer to send almost any kind of data.

## Why would I want this?

People get into Meshtastic for all kinds of reasons:

- **Curiosity and tinkering:** It's a fun electronics project that actually does something useful.
- **Emergency preparedness:** When storms knock out power and cell towers, mesh networks keep working. First responders have their own systems. Now you can have one too.
- **Outdoor activities:** Hiking, biking, camping, or exploring where there's no cell signal.
- **Events and gatherings:** Coordinate with groups at locations that tax the cell networks or are outside their coverage. Music festivals, races, or large gatherings where cell networks get overloaded.
- **Privacy:** Your messages travel directly between radios. No company is (necessarily) storing or reading them.

## Do I need a license or permit?

No. Meshtastic operates on the 915 MHz ISM band in the US, which is license-free and open to anyone. Unlike ham radio, there are no tests, no callsigns, and encryption is allowed.

## What does it cost?

Devices range from about $35 for a DIY build to $50-100 for ready-to-use handheld nodes. Solar-powered nodes for permanent installation run $50-200. There are no subscriptions, no service fees, and no ongoing costs beyond the hardware.

## Why Wichita? Why now?

Flyover Mesh has been building out community infrastructure across Wichita since April 2025. We now have multiple solar-powered community nodes placed in high locations around the city, which means when you get your first device, you're likely to connect to something right away.

We've grown from zero to over 100 active members and 200+ nodes in 10 months. There's an active community ready to help you get started.
