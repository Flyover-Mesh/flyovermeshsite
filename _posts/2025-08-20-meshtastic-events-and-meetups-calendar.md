To encourage connection and learning.

### Weekly Mesh Net:
**Sunday from 8:00pm to 8:30pm**
- This is a chance to try out your equipment and setup. Hop on Long Fast channel, see if you can connect, and to whom.
- At 8pm, get on your node, send a "check in" message via mesh on Long Fast, [join the Discord #events channel](https://discord.gg/5h93pEjTcz), and report any messages you receive.
- Include your approximate location and node node short name e.g.
> “checking in mid-town, k10n”
- Check in on long fast channel on Meshtastic, something like “mesh net check in, k10n”
- Respond in both places when you receive a message on the mesh.
