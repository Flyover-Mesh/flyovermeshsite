## 🚀 Flyover Mesh Update – September 2025

**Off-Grid. On Purpose.**  
Meshtastic community for Wichita, Kansas.

---
### 🏆 **Accomplishments**
Since the last update, the community has been productive! 

- **Community Website Is Live!** 
	- Explore it here: [https://flyovermesh.org](https://flyovermesh.org)
	- There are pages and sections that need updated, and places for your content. If you know how, please submit a pull request! If you don't know Git or GitHub, DM an admin on the Discord for help.
    

- **#meshmap channel bot connections**  
    There are now three stationary bot nodes reporting text messages they receive on Long Fast. This has been very helpful for users testing their connection to others. These nodes are located in three locations currently:
    * Twin Lakes
    * College Hill
    * Rock & Central
Do you have a stationary node and modest Python skills? You, too, can connect your node to the #meshmap channel. Ask how in #advice
        
 **📒 Node Directory Now in Discord!**  
    Made a contact, and want to know more? Look in `#node-directory`. Add your own device, as well. Whether you're stationary or mobile, it's helpful to everyone involved.
	
**Weekly Mesh Nets Are Thriving**  
    Our Sunday 8–8:30PM check-ins have grown into an great way to test your reach, meet people on the mesh, and try out changes to your setup.

**New Flyover Channel**
	- A channel on the mesh for those in the know. It is separate from LongFast. Perfect for focused Wichita comms when Long Fast gets too crowded with "test" and "hello."
	- [Instructions for adding the Channel can be found here.](https://flyovermesh.org/about/#join-the-meshtastic-channel)

### 🗼 Community Nodes 

These nodes are solar-powered and stay online to serve the whole mesh. Right now, we have four well placed community nodes. Buffalo, Bluestem, Blackbear, and Groover. There is hardware ready to install, but we need access to high places. 

Do you have access to a tall building, water tower, or silo? Especially **East of Oliver**? Let’s talk. We’ll handle install and maintenance. We just need your contact.

#### 🧾 You can contribute to expanding the mesh!

**📦 Group orders:** We've done group orders from Rokland, and that saves you money on shipping. BUT it also helps by giving discounts and rewards to the community hardware.

**Contribute directly:** Thanks to our partnership with **devICT**, hardware donations are tax-deductible.

### 🎉 **Events**

#### 🛴 Open Streets ICT | This Weekend

We'll be doing passive testing throughout the day. Bring your node if you’re out walking, biking, or brunching!
Look for me, k10n on the mesh, and I'll have Meshtastic stickers for the first three people to find me.
#### 📡 Weekly Mesh Net

Every Sunday 8:00–8:30PM  
Great time to meet other nodes, test range, and share updates.

### 🧹 **Housekeeping**

- **Discord Cleanup**  
    Channels have been reorganized for ease of use and categorization. Check `#mesh-tasks-tics` for open tasks you can help with (or add your own).
    
- **GitHub Organization Live**  
    Flyover Mesh now has a public [GitHub](https://github.com/FlyoverMesh) for sharing local software, mapping tools, and future builds. Contribute or watch the repos!
