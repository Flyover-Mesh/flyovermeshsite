## 🚀 Flyover Mesh – October Update
Off-grid. On purpose.

BIG REMINDER
🕗 Weekly Mesh Net

Every Sunday (including tonight) | 8:00–8:30 PM
Turn on your node, hop into ⁠events send a message, see how far your message goes. It’s casual, helpful, and fun.

⸻

🗼 New & Updated Community Nodes
    •    🤙 John C. Woods is a brand-new solar node, already extending coverage in central Wichita.
    •    🌾 Bluestem was relocated and is now covering more of the west side.

More nodes are currently being battle-tested. Want better coverage in your area? Got rooftop access? Water tower? Let us know.

⸻

👋 Welcome, New Folks!

We’ve had a ton of new people join and light up new nodes. If you’re new and not sure where to start:
    •    Say hi in Discord #⁠general
    •    Ask for help in Discord #⁠advice 
    •    Or join the next Mesh Net

📡 Mesh Map Bot + MQTT Work in Progress

The Discord #⁠mesh-map channel has been great for seeing live reports.
Now, cr0w and k10n are working on a software that will let any node with MQTT auto-announce messages. No Python skills required.
⸻

🧭 Community Meetup Poll Incoming

Last time we asked, a meetup was the most popular request.
I’ll post a poll later today to find the best time for everyone.

The plan will be to bring Mobile nodes, enough to share for those just curious, and try out the mesh with a planned network.
