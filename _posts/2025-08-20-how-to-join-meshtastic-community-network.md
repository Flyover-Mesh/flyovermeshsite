The best away to get help is to ask in the Discord #advice channel.

### 🔰 GETTING STARTED WITH MESHTASTIC (WICHITA EDITION)
Here’s how to get started:
⸻

📱 1. INSTALL THE MESHTASTIC APP
You’ll use this app to connect your phone to your device and manage settings.

For iPhone:
[App Store Link 🔗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshtastic/id1586432531)

For Android:
[Google Play Link 🔗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&hl=en)

⸻

### Choosing your hardware
The community keeps a list of devices up to date, including recomendations and various features. Buying from the links on this site help support the community nodes.

📡 2. CHOOSE YOUR DEVICE

You’ll need a LoRa device (aka a “node”) to send messages on the mesh.

⸻
### Setting up your hardware

💻 3. FLASH YOUR DEVICE (if needed)

Use the web flasher:
[https://flasher.meshtastic.org](https://flasher.meshtastic.org)
Use Chrome or Edge only (not Firefox)
* Plug in via USB (make sure you're using a USB cable that can transfer data)
* Choose the correct serial port 
* Hit “Flash”
    * Note: For some devices (RAK Wireless), you drag and drop the firmware like you're adding it to a USB drive

Need help? Ask in Discord or wait for a flash party!

### Try out your connections
There are many options!
- 🤖 Send a message on Long Fast, and then check the #mesh-map channel on Discord. If your measage appears there, then it's been sent across the mesh.
- 🎙️ send the message `$ping` or `$hello` or `$weather` and Flyover Mesh Bot will respond to you if it gets your message
- 💬 The simplest way is to wait a momemnt, and see if your app says "Acknoledged" below your message. That's the simplest way to see if your at least communicating with some other nodes.

### Join the Mesh Net events
Each week, we have a scheduled time to send and receive messages. We call that a Mesh Net, which comes from ham radio communities. [Sunday at 8pm.](https://flyovermesh.org/posts/meshtastic-events-and-meetups-calendar/#weekly-mesh-net)
