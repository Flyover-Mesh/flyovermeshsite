# 🚀 Flyover Mesh – January 2026 Update
**Off-grid. On purpose.**

Happy February, everyone! Here's what's been happening across Flyover Mesh.

---

## 📊 Community Growth

Our community is growing faster than ever. We welcomed **20 new folks** in January alone! Whether you're just getting started or already running nodes, thanks for being part of the mesh. If you're new, don't be shy. Drop into <#1362622691429056723> on Discord and say hello.

## 🌐 Website Updates

The [Flyover Mesh website](https://flyovermesh.org) got some love this month:
- **New Recommended Devices page**: A refreshed guide comparing popular Meshtastic hardware to help you pick the right gear. Using the links on those pages help pay for more community nodes.
- **Updated Troubleshooting & Setup Help**: Expanded resources if you're running into issues.
- **Community Node Directory refresh**: Our community nodes are now better documented with locations and install details.

## 🛠️ New Mesh Tools

We now have even more ways to see what's happening on the network:

- **MeshMerge Coverage Map**: [meshmerge.fly.dev/map.html](https://meshmerge.fly.dev/map.html) Visualize node coverage, direct RF links, and inferred mesh reach using data reported by fl0v.
- **Frood Bot Map**: [meshtastic.ekpyroticfrood.net](https://meshtastic.ekpyroticfrood.net/) Another great visualization tool from the broader Meshtastic community.
- **<#1362622853739970722> on Discord**: Check this channel to see if your messages were received by our bots. Great for testing your node's reach!

## 🤖 Active Bots

Two community bots are up and responding:
- **fl0v** (College Hill)
- **HYDB** (Northwest)

Try sending `$ping` or `$info` to see them in action!

## 📡 Community Node News

**Coming Soon: June Bacon-Bercey Node**
Our next community node is being built and will be named after **June Bacon-Bercey** (1928-2019), a Wichita native and true pioneer. She was the first African American woman to earn a degree in meteorology (UCLA, 1954), the first Black female broadcast meteorologist, and the first woman to receive the American Meteorological Society's Seal of Approval. She used her game show winnings to establish a scholarship for women in atmospheric sciences and co-founded the AMS Board on Women and Minorities. A fitting namesake for a node in our mesh! 🌩️

**Hattie Node (East Side)**
The Hattie node connected the east side for a while, but has recently fallen quiet. I checked it out visually yesterday. It's still physically in place, but will need to come down for diagnosis before we can redeploy. Stay tuned for updates.

**Today's Deployments**
I'm planning to set up **two or three nodes today** ahead of the mesh net. Candidates include **Meadowlark**, **Box Turtle**, and/or **John C. Woods**. I'll share updates as they go live!
