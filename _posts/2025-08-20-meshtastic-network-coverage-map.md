A real-time or regularly updated coverage map helps your community know where the network is strong and where it needs reinforcement.

**Key Tips:**
- Use tools like Meshtastic MQTT API, Meshtastic-Map-Viewer, or manually exported coordinates.
- Group nodes by function: Router, Client, or Portable.
- Respect user privacyâ€”blur or offset exact home locations.
- Provide a legend and instructions on how to add a node to the map.
