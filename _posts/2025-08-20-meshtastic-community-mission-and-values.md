## 🌐 Flyover Mesh Mission

Off-grid. On purpose.
We are building an open, resilient, community-powered mesh network for Wichita and beyond—one node, neighbor, and rooftop at a time.

## 🧭 Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be curious. Be constructive.
We don’t tolerate hate, harassment, or exclusion. This is a space for learning, connecting, and growing—together.

🤝 Inclusive & Welcoming

Everyone is welcome here. From tech-savvy or just curious, no one needs to know how radios work to participate. If you’re excited about off-grid communication, we’ll help you get started. The only thing that won't be tolerated is intolerance.

🛠️ Open Source, Decentralized by Design

Flyover Mesh is built with open-source tools, and your contributions, including code, testing, ideas, outreach, make it better. No one owns this network. Our strength is in our decentralization.
