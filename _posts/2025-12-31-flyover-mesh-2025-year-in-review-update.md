## 🎉 Meshtastic Community Update - 2025 Year In Review

Hey everyone! We've had an incredible 2025, and I wanted to share some exciting milestones and what's coming next.

### 📊 Community Growth
Our community continues to expand at an amazing pace:
* 100+ members have joined this Discord server
* 350+ individual nodes have been identified across our region (including many mesh users who haven't joined Discord yet!)
* 8 Highly Placed Community Nodes
* Weekly mesh events continue to bring us together
* Representation at https://flyovermesh.org/

### 🤖 Flyover Mesh Bot & Distributed Collection
The bot infrastructure is leveling up! Our distributed collection nodes are now:
* Reporting aggregated data from across the mesh in ⁠Discord in the #mesh-map channel
* Providing connection tests so you can verify your mesh connectivity
* Delivering visibility through the network

### 📡 Community Node Status
**Active & Connecting:**
Buffalo, Blackbear, Bluestem, Hattie, Woodard, Silivsaurus, and Cottonwood are strategically placed and linking different parts of the city together.

**Ready to Deploy:**
Meadowlark, Box Turtle, and John C. Woods have locations scouted and are ready to go live.

**Coming Soon:**
Several new locations are identified and waiting for hardware. Want to help expand the mesh? Donations of hardware or funds are always appreciated!

### 🗳️ What's Next
Node Naming Poll - Help choose names for upcoming community nodes! We follow the convention of naming nodes after prominent local figures, native nature, or representative ideals.
New Discord Channel - A dedicated buy/sell/trade/give channel has launched in #⁠🤝-swaps  to help members exchange gear and support each other.

**Thanks for being part of this growing community! 🌐**
